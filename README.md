Game Server Project

📌 Overview

This project is a multiplayer game server architecture that integrates different technologies for various components. The stack consists of ZNet for game server networking, PHP for the web application, and Unity for the game client.

🏗️ Tech Stack

1️⃣ Game Server

Technology: ZNet (C#)

Role: Handles multiplayer game logic, player connections, and real-time data synchronization.

Features:

Manages client-server communication efficiently

Supports large-scale concurrent connections

Provides a master server to monitor and control individual game servers

2️⃣ Web Page (Admin & User Dashboard)

Technology: PHP (Backend)

Role: Provides a web interface for game management, user authentication, and statistics tracking.

Features:

User registration and authentication

Game data monitoring and server status checks

Leaderboards and player statistics management

3️⃣ Game Client

Technology: Unity (C#)

Role: Frontend application that players interact with.

Features:

Connects to the game server via ZNet

Handles in-game UI and rendering

Synchronizes real-time data with the server

🔗 Architecture Flow

Unity Game Client → Sends requests to ZNet Game Server for real-time multiplayer interactions.

ZNet Game Server → Processes game logic and synchronizes player actions.

Web Page (PHP Backend) → Stores and retrieves persistent game data, including user profiles, scores, and logs.

Master Server (ZNet) → Manages multiple game servers, handles shutdowns, and monitors connections.

📖 Setup & Deployment

Game Server (ZNet - C#)

Install necessary dependencies for ZNet.

Configure MasterServer settings (IP, Port, MaxConnections).

Start the MasterServer to handle incoming connections.

Web Server (PHP Backend)

Set up an Apache/Nginx server with PHP.

Connect to the game database.

Deploy the PHP scripts to provide API endpoints for the game client and server.

Game Client (Unity - C#)

Import the ZNet library for networking.

Connect to the MasterServer and retrieve game server details.

Implement game logic, synchronization, and real-time updates.

🚀 Future Improvements

Implement WebSockets for enhanced real-time communication.

Add a monitoring dashboard for server performance tracking.

Optimize database queries to improve efficiency.

Introduce a matchmaking system for seamless player connections.

💡 This project aims to provide a scalable multiplayer game infrastructure with seamless communication between the game server, web server, and client.
